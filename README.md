# Project-3
Mystical Musicians

The Mystical Music shop (MM) will consist of a sales application that will allow users to qualify Leads into a trusted, and cared for opportunity. Once that opportunity is created, a user will be guided through a sales life cycle to offer our customers a wide variety of unique, orchestral instruments. All of which are labeled under the Mystical Music line. Our instruments will be marketed to segmented customers that are specifically interested in fine crafted pieces that are built to ensure 5-star quality and professional level sound. If any of our customers may have any issues with our instruments, they may be serviced swiftly with the assistance of one of our trusted customer service representatives within our MM Customer Service environment and under extraordinary service management. If a customer happens to file an inquiry or submit a case on any damaged asset, then one of our highly-skilled field technicians will be scheduled and dispatched to any location that needs services preformed. All cases will be queued and quickly attended to within our MM Field Service environment.
